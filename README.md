# HireSense — AI Resume Ranking Platform

A two-role platform where HR teams post jobs and get AI-ranked applicants,
and candidates browse jobs, apply, and get resume feedback — all powered by
sentence-embedding based semantic matching.

## Features

**HR side**
- Sign up / log in as an HR user
- Post job openings, and close/reopen them once filled
- View applicants per job, automatically ranked by match score
- See matched/missing skills per applicant for explainability
- Add private notes per applicant (e.g. interview impressions)
- Shortlist or reject applicants (candidates see the status update)
- Export the ranked applicant list as a CSV file
- Analytics dashboard: score distribution + most common missing skills across all applicants

**Candidate side**
- Sign up / log in as a candidate
- Upload a resume once (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
- Browse all open jobs with an instant match % against your resume
- Apply to jobs with one click
- Track application status (In review / Shortlisted / Rejected)
- **Status timeline and notifications**: each application shows a timeline (Applied, In review, Shortlisted or Not selected, with dates). When HR changes a status, the candidate sees a red badge on My Applications and a "Recent updates" list
- **ATS score**: a 0-100 readiness score for your resume with a breakdown (contact details, sections, skills, impact, length, clarity), a ranked "what to fix first" list, and an optional keyword check against any job you applied to
- Get personalized feedback: which in-demand skills are missing from your resume,
  each paired with curated free YouTube videos and documentation to learn them
- **Career Assistant chatbot**: paste any job description and ask what skills it
  requires, or have an open conversation about your resume and job search —
  powered by Google's free Gemini API

## Why PostgreSQL instead of SQLite

The original version used SQLite — a single file on disk. That broke in
production: Render's free web services have **no persistent disk**, so every
time the service restarted (idle timeout, redeploy, etc.), the SQLite file
was wiped and recreated empty. That's why job postings, accounts, and
applications kept disappearing without warning.

PostgreSQL is a real, separately-hosted database that survives restarts.
This project uses **[Neon](https://neon.tech)** — a Postgres provider with a
genuinely permanent free tier (no card, no expiration clock), which matters
if your submission is weeks or months away. Render also offers its own
free Postgres, but that one **expires 30 days after creation**, which is too
short for most project timelines — so Neon is used instead, and connected in
via the same `DATABASE_URL` environment variable either way.

## Setting up the database (Neon PostgreSQL)

1. Go to [console.neon.tech/signup](https://console.neon.tech/signup) and sign
   up with Google or GitHub — no credit card required
2. Neon creates a project and a database automatically. On your project's
   dashboard, find the **connection string** (labeled "Connection string" or
   similar) — it looks like: `postgresql://user:password@host/dbname?sslmode=require`
3. Copy that connection string — you'll use it in two places:
   - **Locally:** in `backend/`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste it in as `DATABASE_URL`
   - **On Render:** add it as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (see deployment steps below)

This one Neon database can be reused for both local development and your
deployed Render service — they'll share the same data, which is actually
convenient for testing.

## Setting up the Career Assistant chatbot (Gemini API)

The chatbot needs a free Gemini API key:

1. Get one from [aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (free, no credit card — see setup guide if needed)
2. In the same `.env` file from above, replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your real key
3. Save — the server reads it automatically on startup (via python-dotenv)

**Never commit your `.env` file** — it's already in `.gitignore` so it won't
accidentally get pushed to GitHub. If you skip the Gemini setup, every other
feature still works fine — only the Career Assistant chat will show an error.

## Running locally

```bash
cd resume-ranker-v2
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You'll land on the login screen.

**To test the full flow:**
1. Click "Create an account" → choose "I'm hiring (HR)" → sign up
2. Post a job (e.g. title "Backend Engineer", description mentioning Python/FastAPI/SQL)
3. Log out, sign up again as "I'm job hunting" (candidate) — use a different email
4. Upload a resume (any PDF/DOCX/TXT with some skills mentioned)
5. Go to "Browse Jobs" → you'll see your match % → click "Apply now"
6. Log back in as the HR account → "Job Postings" → "View applicants" → see the ranked applicant, shortlist them
7. Log back in as the candidate → "My Applications" → see the status changed to "Shortlisted"

> First request will be slow (~20-30s) while the embedding model loads. After that it's fast.

## Deploying to Render

1. Push this project to a GitHub repo (see commands below)
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New +** → **Blueprint** → connect your repo
3. Render reads `render.yaml` and will ask you to fill in two values it
   intentionally left blank (secrets never live in the file itself):
   - `DATABASE_URL` — paste your Neon connection string (see above)
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — paste your Gemini key
4. Click **Apply** and wait for the build to finish
5. Your live URL (e.g. `https://hiresense.onrender.com`) is your submission link

> If Render doesn't prompt you for those two values during setup, you can
> always add them afterward: go to the `hiresense` service → **Environment** →
> add `DATABASE_URL` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` there.

> Free tier note: the web service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity and
> takes ~30-60 seconds to wake up on the next request — open the link a
> minute before your demo. This no longer causes data loss (that was the
> SQLite problem) — it's now just a slow first load. Your Neon database stays
> alive and persistent regardless of whether the web service is asleep.

**If you already have an existing Render web service from before:** you can
reuse it — just go to its Environment tab and add `DATABASE_URL` (your Neon
connection string) and confirm `GEMINI_API_KEY` is still set, then trigger a
manual redeploy so it picks up the new `database.py` code.

## Pushing to GitHub

```bash
cd resume-ranker-v2
git init
git add .
git commit -m "HireSense: full two-role platform with auth, ranking, and analytics"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Notes for your report / viva

- The `SECRET_KEY` in `auth.py` is hardcoded for demo simplicity — mention
  that in production it would live in an environment variable
- The ranking core (embeddings + cosine similarity) is unchanged from the
  single-user version — it's just now called once per application instead
  of once per batch upload, and results are persisted per job/candidate pair
- The project originally used SQLite and was migrated to PostgreSQL after
  discovering that Render's free web services have no persistent disk —
  a good real-world lesson about ephemeral vs. persistent storage worth
  mentioning if asked
